We'll be learning about projection and 3D graphics using three.js (https://threejs.org)
At the end of the workshop you will be able to create and manipulate a 3D scene on a web page using three.js and JavaScript.  
You will also learn a little about optics, projectors, and how 3D projection can be used with projectors to do cool stuff.

The workshop will be hosted by Daniel Urquhart and Eric Patterson from Christie Digital Systems.
<<< include our linked in profiles and that photo with us reciving an innovation award, perhaps with funny arrows >>>
  - The workshop will include a short presentation, but most of the time will be left for you to work, learn, and 
  create with Dan and Eric available to answer questions and help out.

Prerequisites
This workshop is open to everyone, however some prior programming experience will be required to get the most out of it.
 - A basic understanding of JavsScript experience would be helpful, but is not required
 - No prior experience with 3D graphics is assumed


Suggested Software
This workshop will rely on the three.js libary; I suggest downloading the entire package here:
    https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/

The only other requirement for this project is a modern web browser, however the tutorial will make use of
 - Chrome (strongly reccomended)
    https://www.google.com/chrome/
 - VSCode (or any text editor)
    https://code.visualstudio.com
 - Python or Node.js to act as a local web server
