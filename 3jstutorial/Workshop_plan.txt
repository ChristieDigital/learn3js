Slides - intro

Show video of city hall, possibly dome room, and talk about possibilities of Javascript with Projection
	- get the video with the smart phone and the sparkles on city hall
	- mention that the multiple outputs in this demo were synchronized with sockets.io, see Carter's presentation from Gamelynx 

Discuss how a projector is just a backwards camera and what we can do with this

Demo live video on a soda can
 - pass out cans and projectors to interested groups

Then walk through how to do it (briefly)
 - I'm thinking of doing a fairly quick walk through, then being around to help teams

1. The tutorial at threejs.org ( this will get you a rotating cube)
2. Add mouse navigation
3. Convert the cube to a cylinder with the right dimensions
4. Add video
5* Point to sample code
